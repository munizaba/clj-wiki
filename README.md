# clj-wiki

A wiki made with Clojure, Yada and Datomic Client.

This is based on the [Edge](https://github.com/juxt/edge) example project. See that projects README for more instructions.

## Libraries
- [Yada](https://github.com/juxt/yada)
- [Datomic Client](http://www.datomic.com/)
- [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) Markdown editor
- [google-diff-match-patch](https://bitbucket.org/cowwoc/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/Home) for diff and patches


## Running locally

### Datomic Client
Get Datomic Pro from [datomic.com](http://www.datomic.com/).
Run a Datomic peer server:
```
datomic-pro-0.9.5544/bin/run -m datomic.peer-server -p 8998 -a wiki,wiki -d wiki,datomic:mem://wiki
```
Make sure the used settings are the same as in `resources/config.edn`.

### Create a location for the file server
Make sure the directory in `resources/config.edn` under the `[:fs2 :private-path]` path points to a folder that is writeable.

### Run the webserver
```
boot dev
```
See the [Edge README.md](https://github.com/juxt/edge/blob/master/README.md) for helpfull tips for repl and CIDER support.
